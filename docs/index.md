# Welcome!

Welcome to the Forest City Labs Framework documentation. The FCL Framework is a collection of components that adhere to [PHP Standards Recommendations](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) wherever possible, creating implementation-agnostic tools that are commonly needed or used within frameworks. The framework specifically targets web applications that function primarily as graphql apis, however, there are many use cases beyond that.

## Standard Install

If you are not interested in how the individual components work and instead want to jump right into building and using a graphql api please check out the [standard install](https://github.com/forestcitylabs/framework-standard-install) repository. This repository chooses sane implementations of all required interfaces and configures them in a way that will suit most use-cases. The documentation for this repository will focus on providing your own implementations.
